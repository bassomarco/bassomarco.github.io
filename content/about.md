ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone!

Iâ€™m Marco, a curious mind passionate about the invisible systems that keep our digital world connected.

If you stopped by to take a look at my blog, thank you! You might be wondering who I am ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™ve been fascinated by the world of networking since high school. Thanks to my school, I discovered the Cisco Networking Academy program, and thatâ€™s really where it all began. After graduating, I continued my studies and earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Telecommunications.

In parallel, I started diving deeper into networking and, after a few months of hard work, I earned my CCNA certification. From that moment on, my journey in the world of networking truly began.

I have a strong interest in good old routing (especially BGP), but Iâ€™m also passionate about Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine) for network access control, as well as the software-defined world, particularly SD-WAN.

Today I work as a Network Consulting Engineer at Cisco, where I get to solve complex challenges, design scalable infrastructures, and collaborate with brilliant people every day.

This blog is where Iâ€™ll share my experiences, lessons learned, and insights from the field, hoping theyâ€™ll be useful (or at least interesting) to others walking a similar path.

If youâ€™d like to suggest a topic for a deep dive related to these areas, or just want to ask me something else, feel free to reach out through my social platforms â€” you can find them in the top-right corner of the website. Iâ€™ll do my best to reply as soon as possible ðŸ™‚

Outside of networking, Iâ€™m also passionate about traveling, hiking, and cinema!

Welcome, and thanks for being here ðŸš€
